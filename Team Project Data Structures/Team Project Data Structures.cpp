* Simulation of a Linux Scheduler using Priority Queues
* Description:
* You are in possession of a program that's been parallelized and employs 𝑛 individual threads to tackle a given list of m jobs or tasks. 
* Threads operate on these tasks in the sequence they appear in the input. Whenever a thread becomes available, it promptly picks up the next job from the list. 
* Once a thread commences processing a job, it proceeds without interruption until the job reaches completion. 
* In cases where multiple threads vie for tasks from the list at the same time, the thread with the lower index takes precedence. 
* Each job comes with a precise processing time, which remains constant across all threads. 
* Your task involves determining both which threads will be responsible for processing each job and when that processing will commence.
